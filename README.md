# Order Management Microservice

A NestJS TypeScript microservice designed to handle order management for multiple e-commerce storefronts, capable of scaling to handle millions of users and orders globally.

## Project Overview

This microservice handles all aspects of order management including:

- Creating orders with products and quantities
- Updating orders with shipping information
- Updating order status (processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Deleting orders

## Architecture

The service is built with NestJS and TypeScript, following a layered architecture:

1. **Controllers**: Handle API requests and route them to services
2. **Services**: Contain business logic and coordinate between repositories and external services
3. **Repositories**: Handle data access abstraction
4. **DTOs**: Define data transfer objects for structured data sharing between layers
5. **Entities**: Define the domain models

## Core Features

### Order Management

- Full CRUD operations for orders
- Status management with validation of state transitions
- Shipping information updates

### External Service Integration

The service communicates with other microservices through:

1. **Synchronous API Calls** - Using HTTP for immediate data needs:
   - Customer Service: Fetches customer details during order creation
   - Inventory Service: Manages product details and inventory levels

2. **Asynchronous Messaging** - Using a message queue for event-driven communication:
   - Order events: Created, Updated, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled
   - Inventory events: Reserved, Released

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

- `GET /orders` - List all orders with optional filtering
- `GET /orders/:id` - Get order details
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order
- `PUT /orders/:id` - Update an existing order
- `PUT /orders/:id/shipping` - Update shipping information
- `PUT /orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `DELETE /orders/:id` - Delete an order

### Messaging Events

The service publishes the following events to the message queue:

- `order.created` - When a new order is created
- `order.updated` - When an order is updated
- `order.shipped` - When shipping information is added
- `order.delivered` - When an order is marked as delivered
- `order.canceled` - When an order is canceled
- `inventory.reserved` - When inventory is reserved for an order
- `inventory.released` - When inventory is released (cancellation/deletion)

### Resilience Features

- Circuit breaking for external service calls
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Deployment Considerations

### AWS Infrastructure

For production deployment, this service would use:

1. **Compute**:
   - AWS ECS Fargate for containerized deployment
   - Auto-scaling based on demand

2. **Networking**:
   - AWS Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
   - API Gateway for API management, throttling, and security

3. **Data Storage**:
   - DynamoDB for order data, taking advantage of its scalability
   - DynamoDB streams to trigger event processing

4. **Messaging**:
   - Amazon SNS/SQS for asynchronous messaging
   - Amazon EventBridge for event routing

5. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics
   - X-Ray for distributed tracing

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of service instances
- Database sharding for multi-region deployment
- Read replicas for high-read workloads
- Caching layers for frequently accessed data

### Resilience

- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Circuit breakers for external service calls
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queues for failed message processing

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run start:dev
```

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Port for the HTTP server (default: 8000)
- `USE_REAL_CUSTOMER_API` - Toggle between real and mock customer API (default: false)
- `USE_REAL_INVENTORY_API` - Toggle between real and mock inventory API (default: false)
- `USE_REAL_MESSAGE_BROKER` - Toggle between real and mock message broker (default: false)
- `CUSTOMER_SERVICE_URL` - URL for the Customer Service API
- `INVENTORY_SERVICE_URL` - URL for the Inventory Service API
- `AMQP_URL` - URL for the RabbitMQ server

## Future Improvements

1. **Data Persistence**: Replace in-memory storage with a proper database
2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement JWT-based authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Metrics**: Add prometheus metrics collection
6. **API Versioning**: Implement formal API versioning
7. **Pagination**: Add pagination for list endpoints
8. **WebSockets**: Add real-time order status updates via WebSockets
9. **Reporting**: Add aggregation and reporting capabilities
